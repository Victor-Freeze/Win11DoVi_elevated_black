# Windows 11 Dolby Vision desktop elevated black level fix

This app addresses the Windows 11 desktop elevated black level in Dolby Vision mode.

Currently, the Windows 11 desktop has an issue - when it is loading in the Dolby Vision mode, the desktop has an elevated black level, which results in distorted gamma.

It has been found that re-initializing the monitor fixes this issue.

This application tries several methods to re-initialize the monitor to fix the elevated black level issue.

_**Unfortunately, you have to run this app at each Windows 11 startup.**_

If you don't want to do it manually each time - you can consider putting the app or a shortcut to it into the Windows StartUp folder (C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup) or add a task to the Windows Scheduler.
